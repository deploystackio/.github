# Welcome to DeployStack

[DeployStack](https://deploystack.io) is an open-source organization that simplifies the deployment process for containerized applications. We provide tools and resources that translate docker-compose.yml files into cloud-agnostic Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates. Our mission is to empower developers and open-source enthusiasts by offering flexible, scalable, and one-click deployment solutions.
